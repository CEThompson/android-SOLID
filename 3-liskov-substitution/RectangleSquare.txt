public class Square extends Rectangle {
	// overrides...
}

// 1. Contravariance of arguments: both classes have same arguments so this rule is followed
// 2. Covariance of results: both classes do not return results from methods so this rule is followed 
// 3. Exception rule: no exceptions thrown so this rule is followed

// 4. Precondition rule: seems that this rule is followed
// 5. Postcondition rule: seems that this rule is followed

// 6. Invariant rule: square class adds 1 additional invariant
	// Square invariant: width = height
	// This rule is not exactly violated, 
	// but the constraints on setwidth/setheight
	// would make this invariant impossible

// 7. Constraint rule: constraints of rect set width is that it changes to width set afterwards
	// ALSO it will not change height
	// However in square setwidth must change setheight to satisfy invariant
	// Therefore in this specific case the constraint rule is in violation
