Primary benefits of DIP

1. Protection from future changes in requirements
2. Reusability
3. Break dependency on external modules
4. Easier integration between modules
5. Better visibility and accountability

Costs
1. More effort to implement
2. More effort to change (wrong abstraction can be more expensive than no abstraction)
3. Increased code complexity due to indirection (Biggest code of DIP) 


**** Invert dependencies only when the benefits outweigh the costs
